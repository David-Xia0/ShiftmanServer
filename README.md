softeng251 Assignment 2 (2019 sem1)

## Description

For this project we were asked to develop the back end for a work shift management system. The system was meant to be able to create shifts, register workers and assign particular workers to those shifts. Then all shifts for the week, or for a given day could be displayed(output as a string).
